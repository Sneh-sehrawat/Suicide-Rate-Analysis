Exciting Data Science Exploration! Partnering with Aakash Sangwan, this project delves into the critical analysis of suicide rates, uncovering valuable insights into this pressing societal issue. By leveraging advanced regression modeling techniques, we aimed to predict future trends in suicide numbers, providing a data-driven perspective on a sensitive topic. To complement the analysis, we designed a visually compelling and interactive dashboard using Power BI, transforming raw data into an immersive desktop experience. This project not only highlights complex patterns within the dataset but also fosters a deeper understanding of societal challenges through the lens of data science.
